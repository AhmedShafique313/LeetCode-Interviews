# Problem Codes in the Interviews:
### TWO SUM
The "Two Sum" problem is one of the most commonly asked coding questions in technical interviews and is also categorized as an easy-level problem on LeetCode.


The goal is to find two numbers in a given list whose sum equals a specific target value, and return their indices.


Example:


If the target is `10` and the list is `[1, 8, 2, 6, 5]`, then the pair of numbers that add up to `10` is `8 + 2`.
The indices of these two numbers are `[1, 2]`, so that would be the correct output.
